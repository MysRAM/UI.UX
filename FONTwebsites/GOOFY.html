        <P>This is my sentence utilizing goofy font.  It was hard for me to choose because
            I found myself talking like a robot, a cowboy, a vampire depending on the font.
            Then some fonts took me back in time, anywho, I went with the Alice in Wonderland 
            feel after the trip I just endured.
